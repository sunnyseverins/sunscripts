## SUNSCRIPTS
A bunch of scripts I made for myself.
### **kill process**
A script that makes ending processes really fast.
1. Download the script.
2. Launch it, enter the name of a process you want to be able to shut fast (e.g. **telegram**). It will create both a script and a searchable link for that. Original file can be removed, lest needed for other "kill" shortcuts.
3. Press Win, start typing **kill telegram**, then press Enter.
4. PROFIT, fast and easy keyboard-only way to close apps.

Although the realization is weak, it is enough to speed up things. Might fail closing some services (permission shenanigans). If you need to finetune/remove stuff created, visit:
- For scripts: *%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Scripts*.
- For shortcuts: *%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Scripts* or via RMB -> Open File Location.
