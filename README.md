## SUNSCRIPTS

A bunch of scripts I made for myself that create a script+shortcut each that in turn do some stuff, accessible from search. Usage example:
1. Download a relevant script (say, **kill telegram**).
2. Launch it. It will create both a script and a searchable link. Original file can be removed.
3. Press Win, start typing **kill telegram**, then press Enter.
4. PROFIT.

Although the realization is weak, it is enough.
